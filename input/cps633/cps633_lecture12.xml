        <question>What security service do denial-of-service attacks target?</question>
        <answer>Availability.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Describe denial-of-service (DoS).</question>
        <answer>DoS is an action that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What are three categories of resources that a denial-of-service attack can exhaust?</question>
        <answer>1. Networks: overwhelm network capacity and operations of a system, eg. flooding attacks.
2. Systems: exhaust system resources, eg. SYN spoofing attacks.
3. Applications: remove or limit an application resources, eg. attacks on a web or a database service.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is the basic idea behind a flooding attack?</question>
        <answer>Use high capacity network resources to overwhelm a lower capacity network connection, eg. Flooding ping.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What are some drawbacks to the attack in using a flooding attack?</question>
        <answer>• Attacker is (easily) identified: attacker needs a spoof source address (easy to do): can result in backscatter traffic: use of Honey Pots (e.g.. Honey Net project).
• The attack can be reflected on the attacker.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is the basic idea behind a SYN spoofing attack?</question>
        <answer>Overflow the TCP connection table with spoof address resulting in connection requests from legitimate users to fail.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is an advantage to SYN spoofing attacks over flooding attacks?</question>
        <answer>Unlike flooding attacks, SYN spoofing attacks can be mounted using relatively low volume of traffic.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What are some common types of network packets used for flooding attacks?</question>
        <answer>Common types are ICMP, UDP, and TCP SYN.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Provide and example of ICMP Flooding.</question>
        <answer>Use ICMP echo request packets to create a ping flood.
Much more likely to be allowed through firewalls.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Provide and example of UDP Flooding.</question>
        <answer>Direct UDP packets at the diagnostic echo service running at some port on the system.
Regardless of whether the service is running or not on the system, the response will increase the load on the system!</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Provide and example of TCP SYN Flooding.</question>
        <answer>Use large volume of TCP SYN or data packets targeted at the victim’s system.
Similar approach as SYN spoofing attack, however it aims to exhaust network bandwidth with the large traffic volume used.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What are two ways that flooding attacks can be differentiated?</question>
        <answer>1. Attacks using one single system as the source versus multiple systems as the source.
2. Attacks can be direct or indirect.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Name three examples of indirect attacks?</question>
        <answer>1. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
2. Reflector attacks.
3. Amplifier attacks.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is the typical architecture of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack?</question>
        <answer>Architecture typically involves a command-and-control setup.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is the basic idea of most application-based attacks?</question>
        <answer>Make the target execute a large number of resource-consuming operations (disproportionate to attacker’s efforts).</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What are two HTTP-based attacks?</question>
        <answer>1. HTTP Flood: Make http request that consumes lots of memory, processing, or transmission resources.
2. Slowloris: Make legitimate, but incomplete requests to the http server.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is an advantage that an indirect DDoS attack like reflection attacks have?</question>
        <answer>No backscatter traffic.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is a disadvantage to reflection attacks versus SYN spoofing attacks?</question>
        <answer>It needs to be able to create a successful spoofed packet which is not the case with SYN spoofing or flooding attacks.s</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Describe the indirect DDoS amplification attack.</question>
        <answer>A variant of reflection attacks, that amplifies the attacks by using a number of intermediaries, for example by sending the original request to a broadcast address of a network.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>Name four general DDoS countermeasures.</question>
        <answer>1. Prevention and preemption (before the attack).
2. Detection and filtering (during the attack).
3. Source traceback and identification (during and after the attack).
4. Reaction (after the attack).</answer>
