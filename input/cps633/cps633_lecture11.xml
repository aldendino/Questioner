        <question>What are three methods of information theft?</question>
        <answer>1. Keyloggers: captures keystrokes on the infected machine to allow an attacker to monitor this sensitive information. Examples include: KeySnatch, Spyster, and KeyLogger Pro.
2. Phishing: exploits social engineering to leverage userÕs trust by masquerading as communications from a trusted source. This is a form of non-malware threat that is often associated with malware.
3. Spear-Phishing: Carefully crafted e-mail spoofing fraud that target specific individuals or organizations.</answer>

        <question>What are two types of stealthing?</question>
        <answer>1. Backdoor or Trapdoor: a (secret) entry point into a program that allows some- one who is aware of the backdoor to gain access without going through the usual security access procedures.
2. Rootkit: a collection of files that is installed on a system to alter its standard functionality in a malicious and stealthy way. A rootkit typically makes many changes to a system to hide the rootkit’s existence, making it very difficult to determine that the rootkit is present and to identify what the rootkit has changed.</answer>

        <question>Name four general elements of malware countermeasure strategy.</question>
        <answer>1. Policy: Ensure that organizations’ policies address prevention of malware incidents.
2. Awareness: Explain proper rules of behaviour for use of an organization’s IT systems and information.
3. Vulnerability Mitigation: Should have documented policy, processes, and procedures for vulnerability mitigation and should also consider creating a vulnerability management program to assist in mitigation efforts. (use a layered defense approach).
4. Threat Mitigation: In addition to their vulnerability mitigation efforts, organizations should perform threat mitigation to detect and stop malware before it can affect its targets. For example, security tools such as: antivirus software, spyware detection and removal utilities, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and firewalls should be used.

        <question>If malware prevention techniques fail, what is the next step?</question>
        <answer>If the prevention techniques fail, the next steps in threat mitigation strategy is to detect, identify, and remove the malware.</answer>

        <question>What are the two perimeter scanning approaches?</question>
        <answer>1. Ingress monitors: These are located at the border between the enterprise network and the Internet.
2. Egress monitors: These can be located at the egress point of individual LANs on the enterprise network as well as at the border between the enterprise network and the Internet.</answer>
