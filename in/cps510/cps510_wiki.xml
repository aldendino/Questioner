        <question>What are the objectives of normalization beyond 1NF (First Normal Form)?</question>
        <answer>1. To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies.
2. To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations, as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs.
3. To make the relational model more informative to users.
4. To make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.</answer>

        <question>What is Functional dependency?</question>
        <answer>In a given table, an attribute Y is said to have a functional dependency on a set of attributes X (written X → Y) if and only if each X value is associated with precisely one Y value.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Full functional dependency?</question>
        <answer>An attribute is fully functionally dependent on a set of attributes X if it is:
    - functionally dependent on X, and
    - not functionally dependent on any proper subset of X.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Transitive dependency?</question>
        <answer>A transitive dependency is an indirect functional dependency, one in which X→Z only by virtue of X→Y and Y→Z.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Trivial functional dependency?</question>
        <answer>A trivial functional dependency is a functional dependency of an attribute on a superset of itself.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Multivalued dependency?</question>
        <answer>A multivalued dependency is a constraint according to which the presence of certain rows in a table implies the presence of certain other rows.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Join dependency?</question>
        <answer>A table T is subject to a join dependency if T can always be recreated by joining multiple tables each having a subset of the attributes of T.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is a Superkey?</question>
        <answer>A superkey is a combination of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a database record. A table might have many superkeys.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is a Candidate key?</question>
        <answer>A candidate key is a special subset of superkeys that do not have any extraneous information in them: it is a minimal superkey.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is a Non-prime attribute?</question>
        <answer>A non-prime attribute is an attribute that does not occur in any candidate key.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is a Prime attribute?</question>
        <answer>A prime attribute is an attribute that does occur in some candidate key.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is a Primary key?</question>
        <answer>One candidate key in a relation may be designated the primary key. While that may be a common practice (or even a required one in some environments), it is strictly notational and has no bearing on normalization. With respect to normalization, all candidate keys have equal standing and are treated the same.</answer>

        <question>What is First normal form?</question>
        <answer>The domain of each attribute contains only atomic values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Second normal form?</question>
        <answer>No non-prime attribute in the table is functionally dependent on a proper subset of any candidate key.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Third normal form?</question>
        <answer>Every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on every candidate key in the table. The attributes that do not contribute to the description of the primary key are removed from the table. In other words, no transitive dependency is allowed.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Elementary key normal form?</question>
        <answer>Every non-trivial functional dependency in the table is either the dependency of an elementary key attribute or a dependency on a superkey.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Boyce–Codd normal form?</question>
        <answer>Every non-trivial functional dependency in the table is a dependency on a superkey.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Fourth normal form?</question>
        <answer>Every non-trivial multivalued dependency in the table is a dependency on a superkey.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Fifth normal form?</question>
        <answer>Every non-trivial join dependency in the table is implied by the superkeys of the table.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Domain/key normal form?</question>
        <answer>Every constraint on the table is a logical consequence of the table's domain constraints and key constraints.</answer>
    </question-type>
    <question-type>
        <question>What is Sixth normal form?</question>
        <answer>Table features no non-trivial join dependencies at all (with reference to generalized join operator).</answer>
